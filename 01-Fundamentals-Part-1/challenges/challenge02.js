/**
 * Coding Challenge #2
  Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
  improve it.
  Your tasks:
  1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
  is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
  2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
  BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
  Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰
  GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
